		<p><h3>Skittles were first made commercially in 1974 by a British company. An animated television advertisement from that year bears
			 the logo of the "Galaxy" company and is copyrighted by Jack Candies Ltd, a Mars distribution subsidiary. They were first 
			 introduced in North America in 1979 as an import confectionery. In 1982, domestic production of Skittles began in the United
			 States.The name of the candy, Skittles, comes from the sports game of the same name, named as such for the resemblance of 
			 the sweet to items used in the game.<br>
             Skittles' "taste the rainbow" theme was created by the New York ad agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles.</h3></p>

	<h1 style="text-decoration: underline;"> DESCRIPTION</h1><br>
	<p><h3>Skittles are produced in a wide variety of flavors and colors, including sour varieties. Skittles has hinted at new flavor 
		releases on its Facebook page, using such statuses as "Locking myself in the Rainbow kitchen until I see some results!"
		 A 2011 posting contained confirmation of a new flavor: "Putting the last touches on a new Skittles flavor. Tweak the Rainbow."
        In the United States and Canada, in 2013, Skittles replaced the lime-flavored Skittles with green apple, causing a backlash 
		from many consumers. The lime flavor became part of the Darkside packets, which were discontinued in 2015 and followed up by 
		the Orchards packets, which were discontinued in 2017. Lime was also part of the "Long Lost Lime" packets that came out in summer 
		2017 and 2018. The Darkside flavor was revived in 2019. In 2021, the "All Lime" packets containing only the lime flavor were 
		released for a limited time. In September 2021, Skittles announced that the green apple-flavored Skittles would be replaced with
		 the original lime flavor. In 2022, Skittles Gummies were released.</h3></p>
